environment and creation of pacs related support procedures and documentation, my responsibilities quickly expanded to is projects where i identified productivity improvements that could be made.  some of these projects included: becoming the 24/7 dedicated technical resource for all radiology functions, meaningful use implementation coordination, fileserver redesign for more stable and productive use, network and system optimizations where needed to improve efficiency, outlying clinic improvements to encourage ""single-company"" relations, and a number of others where needed.  my

to   jul 2011     my hiring position at cpsi was as a senior project manager in the its special projects division.  after only 3 months in this position, i was recruited into the imagelink pacs division as an implementation project manager.  before being promoted to assistant manager then manager of this division, my primary responsibilities were system install scheduling, preparation and complete onsite implementation.  the three week onsite implementation of the imagelink system entailed; coordinating server placement and networking with hospital it, directing the installation of all server and reading hardware, coordination with all modality vendors to establish dicom communication with the new system, integration with cpsi and other vendor his, radiologist and staff training  and conversion of data from the previous radiology system.  a number of these sites requested that we perform the conversion of data without involving the previous vendor.  success in these situations required developing an in-depth familiarity with numerous systems, including: mckesson, ge centricity, philips isite, orthoview, e-film and spectra pacs systems. because responsibilities included development planning with programming and travel with sales to assist in promoting the imagelink product, i acquired additional familiarity with these competitor systems in order to keep imagelink current with the needs of our customers and provide my employees with training relevant to their implementations.  this broad spectrum of involvement with multiple pacs systems left me knowledgeable on their use, tools and configuration.

  company name    －    city  ,   state        architected and developed an innovative product called ""ibor 1.0"" to provide real-time market values,exposures and related analytics using operational data store(ods). this product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,etf) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). a game changing product being used very broadly at wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.  designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.  delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. as a result, i have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.  built a very strong and

to build ibor+ using proprietary technology and database using htap architecture. as a principal architect on ibor+, i designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized ibor architecture. ibor+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. ibor+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. ibor+ is a foundational data
